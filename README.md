# Monte-carlo-simulation-to-estimate-option-value-using-python

In this code:

#S = Current stock Price

#X = Strike Price

#years = Time to maturity (months or years)

#rf = risk free interest rate

#steps = time steps

#sig = volatility 
 
I defined the stock price using a function

Used Monte Carlo simulation using 1000 (or any) loops to estimate option value
